## Notes

If you see a top or lowest _k_ being mentioned in the question, it is usually a signal that a heap can be used to solve the problem, such as in [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/).

If you require the top _k_ elements use a Min Heap of size _k_. Iterate through each element, pushing it into the heap. Whenever the heap size exceeds _k_, remove the minimum element, that will guarantee that you have the _k_ largest elements.
